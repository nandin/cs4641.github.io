## Introduction
Now more than ever, people do not step foot into a restaurant without copious amounts of research on the internet. Particularly evident in a tourist-friendly city like Las Vegas, restaurant owners continually search for the perfect combination of offerings that will make consumers give them a good review. An investment in better reviews will hopefully lead to a greater influx of consumers. Our study focuses on Yelp, which is rated the most frequented review site. We hope to identify the key factors that contribute to restaurants obtaining a higher score in Las Vegas. By predicting the review score after particular investments, we will help restaurant owners direct their future investments.
